Number Guessing Game
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game project! This is a simple JavaScript-based game where the player has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The player receives feedback on whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct.

Project Features
Random Number Generation: A random number between 1 and 100 is generated when the game starts.
User Input: The player enters their guess through an input field.
Feedback: The game provides feedback about whether the guess is too high or too low, or if the player has successfully guessed the correct number.
Attempts Counter: The number of attempts the player has made is tracked and displayed.
Restart Option: A restart button allows the game to begin again with a new random number.
How It Works
Start the Game:

The game starts by generating a random number between 1 and 100 using the Math.random() function.
The player makes guesses by entering numbers in the input field and pressing the "Submit" button.
Feedback on Guess:

If the guess is correct, a message displays, congratulating the player.
If the guess is too high, a message will say "Too high! Try again".
If the guess is too low, a message will say "Too low! Try again".
Attempts Counter:

Each time the player makes a guess, the number of attempts is incremented and displayed on the screen.
Restart the Game:

The player can click the "Restart" button to start a new game with a new random number and reset the attempt counter.
